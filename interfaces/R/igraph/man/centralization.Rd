\details{
  Centralization is a general method for calculating a graph-level
  centrality score based on node-level centrality measure. The
  formula for this is

  \deqn{C(G)=\sum_v (\max_w c_w - c_v),}{
    C(G)=sum( max(c(w), w) - c(v),v),}
  
  where \eqn{c_v}{c(v)} is the centrality of vertex \eqn{v}.

  The graph-level centrality score can be normalized by dividing by the
  maximum theoretical score for a graph with the same number of
  vertices, using the same parameters, e.g. directedness, whether we
  consider loop edges, etc.

  For degree, closeness and betweenness the most centralized structure
  is some version of the star graph, in-star, out-star or undirected
  star.

  For eigenvector centrality the most centralized structure is the graph
  with a single edge (and potentially many isolates).

  \code{centralize.scores} using the general centralization formula to
  calculate a graph-level score from vertex-level scores.

  \code{centralization.degree}, \code{centralization.closeness},
  \code{centralization.betweenness} calculate both the vertex-level and
  the graph-level indices.

  \code{centralization.degree.tmax},
  \code{centralization.closeness.tmax},
  \code{centralization.betweenness.tmax} and
  \code{centralization.evcent.tmax} return the theoretical maximum
  scores. They operate in two modes. In the first mode, a graph is given
  and the maximum score is calculated based on that. E.g. the number of
  vertices and directedness is taken from this graph.

  The other way to call these functions is to omit the
  \code{graph} argument, but explicitly specify the rest of the
  arguments.
