\title{Generate coordinates to place the vertices of a graph in a
  star-shape}
\description{
  A simple layout generator, that places one vertex in the center of a
  circle and the rest of the vertices equidistantly on the perimeter.
}
\usage{
layout_as_star(graph, center = V(graph)[1], order = NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{graph}{The graph to layout.}
  \item{center}{The id of the vertex to put in the center. By default it
    is the first vertex.}
  \item{order}{Numeric vector, the order of the vertices along the
    perimeter. The default ordering is given by the vertex ids.}
}
\details{
  It is possible to choose the vertex that will be in the center, and
  the order of the vertices can be also given.
}
\value{A matrix with two columns and as many rows as the number of
  vertices in the input graph.}
